# Numerical-integration-methods-for-orbital-motion
Fortran Code made for AM1 in the Masters in Space Systems at UPM. Uses the NumericalHub Repository by jahrWork

Uses jahrWork API for CauchyProblem to integrate a number of orbits using Euler, Inverse Euler, Runge-Kutta methods, GBS methods and ABM methods.

Content:

- Kepler Orbits (Circular and Elliptical)
- Halo Orbits
- Arenstorf Orbits
- Shampine-Gordon Orbits
- Lyapunov Orbits L1 L2 L3
- Henon-Heiles system
- Comparisons between the various integrators used
